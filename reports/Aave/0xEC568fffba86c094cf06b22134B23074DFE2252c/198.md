## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V3 Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

## Abstract

Gauntlet aims to isolate assets that are susceptible to infinite mint attacks, possess non-standard token functionality, or may otherwise have inherent and unpredictable risks. The debt ceiling is designed to restrict protocol exposure to price swings and potential resulting insolvencies.

Gauntlet's methodology for isolation mode is described [here](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290).

## Motivation

See the [forum post](https://governance.aave.com/t/gauntlet-aave-v3-isolation-mode-methodology/12290) for full details.

## Specification

Per [Snapshot Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb1f8b1814d9c09760daa4d7e9fa90d906b2c9ff5fbd20c8d0f5793c4f5cc4999), the community has decided on the Aggressive option.

## Implementation

The proposal updates the debt ceiling of the listed assets using two pre-deployed payloads, which use the Aave Config Engine to update the debt ceilings:

- Arbitrum: [`0x4393277b02ef3ca293990a772b7160a8c76f2443`](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x4393277b02ef3ca293990a772b7160a8c76f2443#code)
- Polygon: [`0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec`](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6bce15b789e537f3aba3c60cb183f0e8737f05ec#code)

Payload implementation and tests can be found [here](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals/pull/120)

Avalanche changes will be made via a Guardian Steward at a later date.
