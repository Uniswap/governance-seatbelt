  <summary>Proposal text</summary>

## Summary

A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH. Given the current market situation, out of an abundance of caution, we propose temporarily pausing borrowing of UNI. Although the risk profile of UNI is lower than the assets in [AIP 121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=121), the community may elect to pause UNI borrowing depending on risk preference.

## Implementation

The proposal sets the LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `disableBorrowingOnReserve` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` using the address specific to each token.
