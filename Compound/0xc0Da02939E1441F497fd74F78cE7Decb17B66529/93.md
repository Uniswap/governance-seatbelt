> # Contribute funding to the Nomic Foundation
> ## **Summary**
> - Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.
> - The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.
> - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.
> - The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.
> - Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.
> - **We’re proposing to Compound Governance to make a contribution of $2m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**
> ## **Funding**
> The Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.
> The Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.
> ## **Why Compound?**
> Generally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.
> The projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create value for the entire ecosystem, including Compound. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:
> 1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).
> 2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.
> 3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.
> 4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.
> 5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.
> We believe this grows the market for everyone, including Compound, and we’d love to have the Compound DAO contribute $2m in funding to this community effort.
