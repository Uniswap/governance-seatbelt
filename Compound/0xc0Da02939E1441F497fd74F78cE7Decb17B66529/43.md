> # Governance Analysis Period
> Following the upgrade to the [Governor Bravo](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/42), it's now possible to update the parameters of the Governance system.
> 
> Over the past year, a recurring request has been a [formal analysis period](https://www.comp.xyz/t/formal-analysis-period-for-larger-proposals/70) before proposals enter the voting state. This would allow the community and developers additional time to audit new contracts and proposals for errors, and users the opportunity to move COMP or delegations prior to a vote commencing.
> 
> This proposal updates the proposal [voting delay](https://compound.finance/docs/governance#voting-delay) from 1 block to 13140 blocks (2 days), and the voting period from 17280 blocks (2.63 days) to 19710 blocks (3 days). These parameter changes will improve the community’s ability to prepare for votes and increase the security of the protocol.
