> # Continuous Security Engineering for Compound
> # Executive summary
> 
> Compound seeks to prevent insecure proposals from being merged via the decentralized governance process. Trail of Bits will provide comprehensive software assurance services to mitigate this risk across three specific activities: consulting services, security engineering, and process creation.
> 
> We believe it is essential to create an easy-to-follow process with highly robust tools that makes security transparent, with or without a code review from Trail of Bits. We consider the primary goal as building capacity in the Compound ecosystem to secure itself. To that end, we will provide engineering efforts to develop critical security infrastructure and processes.
> 
> Trail of Bits will be paid the equivalent of $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year to provide the baseline services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.
> 
> Trail of Bits spoke on Discord at the Compound Community Dev Call and carved out [my part of the presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYQ_A5EewK73ZtLZ_wvKpPFLYwCvVznX/view?usp=sharing) so you can listen to it briefly since it may add color to the proposal.
> 
> # Goals and Non-Goals
> 
> Goals of this effort include:
> 
> * Prevent insecure code from being merged into Compound through the governance process, and ensure that any remaining risks of proposals under consideration are well known before a vote. Compound desires services that eliminate and illuminate these risks.
> * Provide first-class security tools and analytical capabilities to Compound developers. Compound developers must have every opportunity to analyze their code and understand its security ramifications. Compound desires a variety of tools that enable thorough inspection of code by developers and users.
> * Create repeatable processes that build capacity for security and avoid dependence on external audits or third-party services for security. Security efforts should result in higher quality code being developed by the Compound community over time through the adoption of consistent processes.
> 
> Non-goals of this effort include:
> 
> * Deploy, configure, or maintain on-chain monitoring software. This goal does not address the security of governance proposals. These systems are an active field of research, may apply to fewer attacks than expected, or may have undesirable performance costs. Instead, we will commit to evaluating their opportunities and limitations during the project.
> * Further development of the bug bounty program. We support the formation of a [bug bounty proposal](https://www.comp.xyz/t/bug-bounty-program-for-compound-proposals/2590) to specifically address this issue. We will provide consultative advice to this proposal based on our years of [experience](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/01/14/on-bounties-and-boffins/) seeing both ends of the bounty ecosystem.
> 
> # Description of the Services
> 
> ## 1. Consulting services
> 
> Trail of Bits will provide at least one full-time security engineer, with additional engineers supporting the project as needed, to perform the following consulting services:
> 
> * **Maintain a presence on Discord and the Compound forums.** We will actively engage in conversation, reach out to developers as needed, and identify any new proposals.
> * **Provide proposal authors with 1:1 counseling sessions.** We will host a video call with the author to understand their goals and provide immediate feedback, including on the architectural design of their proposal and suggestions to reduce complexity.
> * **Review and report any identified security issues in the code for proposals.** We will describe the issue, a scenario to abuse it, and a recommendation to address it. We will work with proposal authors to validate fixes that result from these reports.
> * **Define security properties for proposals.** We will work with the authors to provide reasonable security invariants alongside the proposal and tests for them in Certora, Echidna, or other tools, as appropriate for the specific invariants under test.
> * **Document “Security Considerations” for every proposal.** We will contribute a standardized section to reviewed proposals to inform developers and users of limitations, risks, or other considerations to form an opinion about their vote on it.
> * **Provide our analysis directly to the community.** Before a vote on any governance issue, we will host a public community call, walk attendees through the documented Security Considerations, and run test suites, fully informing their decisions to vote.
> * **Host bi-weekly Office Hours with developers.** We will cover testing and verification tools, demonstrate new security processes and tools for Compound, and solicit feedback for new areas of development and guidance needed by the community.
> * **Evaluate new security techniques for adoption by Compound.** We will perform detailed evaluations of the applicability of these techniques *directly on the Compound codebase*, sharing our empirical results of efficacy and utility.
> * **Ad-hoc services sourced from across Trail of Bits**, as needed. This includes expertise from our separate teams for cryptography, application security, cloud-native security, threat modeling, machine learning, and other research teams. Our firm employs more than 80 researchers servicing clients in tech, defense, and finance on high-risk security challenges.
> 
> ## 2. Security engineering
> 
> Trail of Bits will engineer solutions in software to critical security risks faced by Compound. We will ensure that first-class security tools are available, easy to use, and customized for use on Compound, with knowledge of Compound-specific risks built in.
> 
> * **Ensure that [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), our static analysis framework, and [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna), our rapid security property tester, always work on Compound code.** These security tools are delicate machines that must ingest all code possible to write in Solidity and EVM. We will ensure that no breaking changes affect Compound for an extended period of time and these tools always "just work."
> * **Customize Slither and Echidna to the Compound codebase.** We will extend each tool to understand Compound’s architecture, expected security properties, and third-party protocols, vastly enhancing their depth of results. For example, we can build static analyses that understand and aggregate data from Certora properties or that understand specific Compound interfaces.
> * **Customize Slither to evaluate the security of upgrades.** Upgradeability exposes low-level complexity with possibly disastrous results. Slither already [evaluates for 17 such flaws](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Upgradeability-Checks), and we will enhance this analysis with Compound-specific conditions.
> * **Develop scaffolding for new proposals with pre-integrated security analyses** from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or others, as appropriate. These templates will provide secure beginnings for parameter changes, new tokens, protocol features, and governance changes.
> * **Continuously define and evaluate security properties across the Compound codebase** with analyses from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or other techniques, as appropriate. New proposals may expose under-specified areas of Compound that require greater formalization. We will work to fill in these gaps with new properties.
> 
> ## 3. Repeatable processes
> 
> Trail of Bits will build the capacity of the Compound community to secure itself, minimizing dependency on external security audits for security and most efficiently using their time when engaged. We will define and socialize repeatable processes that encapsulate common tasks with security integrated within them. Adoption of these processes will set a floor on proposal quality, continuously secure proposals regardless of security auditor review, and improve the quality of proposals over time.
> 
> * **Design a repeatable process for starting a new proposal.** We will develop onboarding guidance for developers that describes the end-to-end process for securely creating new proposals. Touchpoints will include security training, using pre-created templates, example security properties, guidance on tools, self-assessment, engaging with Trail of Bits for code review.
> * **Design a repeatable process for proposal [self-assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md)**. We will provide guidance to assess the security of proposals before sharing them publicly. This will facilitate more effective conversations about security with the community and Trail of Bits, knowing that an initial baseline has been met.
> * **Design a repeatable process for risk assessment by the community.** We will share the risk factors that security experts focus on when reviewing proposals and document steps to run testing and verification tools, thus providing a map for those voting on proposals to become better informed and obtain empirical evidence.
> * **Design a repeatable process for evaluating [third-party protocol integration risks](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/development-guidelines/token_integration.md).** We will design a repeatable process to investigate the security considerations of new token implementations and other linkages to DeFi building blocks from Compound. We will document existing pitfalls and concerns in third-party code already used by Compound, and facilitate the discovery and documentation of others.
> * **Design a repeatable process for other protocols to securely integrate with Compound.** In the reverse of the above, we will describe security considerations for DeFi users of Compound. In our mind, any compromise involving Compound, even if it does not originate from our own code, will compromise its reputation.
> * **Regularly update a “treasure map” for bug hunting in Compound.** We will guide other security researchers to less specified, more risky areas of the code. We will regularly report statistics on these identified hotspots, such as % coverage for specifications.
> 
> # Risks
> 
> Compound may have unknown, latent security vulnerabilities already present in the code. Our proposal focuses on new code added to Compound and, therefore, these issues may continue undiscovered. To mitigate this risk, we have included a) a task focused on specifying new security properties, as needed, and b) a task to build a treasure map to aid other bug hunters.
> 
> COMP holders may vote for proposals that contain documented security risk or that are otherwise highly risky, considering the reward to be greater in that circumstance. To mitigate this risk, we will a) add documented Security Considerations to every proposal and b) host a community call to walk through those considerations, demonstrate how to run included test suites, and evaluate the coverage of them.
> 
> Compound is highly complex and new proposals may use new features of Solidity or combine features of Solidity in ways that break the security tools upon which it depends. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has specifically prioritized the development and testing of new features for Slither and Echidna against the Compound codebase.
> 
> Proposals may require swift approval without waiting for input from Trail of Bits, or input from Trail of Bits may be otherwise unavailable within the timeframe required due to unknown circumstances. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has proposed a robust sequence of processes and tools for the community to enhance trust in themselves and better understand the risks of their actions.
> 
> # Financial Terms
> 
> Trail of Bits will be streamed the equivalent of $4 million USD in COMP (at today's price) for one year to provide the services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.
